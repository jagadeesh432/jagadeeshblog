Hi there,This is jagadish.
this post is about my educational experience.How it came all the way from an upside position to almost nothing left to go below.


well,like every indian student believes as their marks is the only path that draw us into success.I started my career with good percentage of marks by crashing tons of books in narayana and sri chaitanya factories.
i faced my first failure in eamcet which i aimed to score atleast 10k below rank.then  i learned to study in a 'b' graded college as a 'b' graded student.


Now i am a final year student.At present,my plans were very high than my capability that is to do my masters by scoring in  GRE.I am very unsure how this is gonna happen,but miracles exist.let's see.......
